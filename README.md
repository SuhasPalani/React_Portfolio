# React Portfolio App Setup - Welcome to the React Portfolio App! 


This guide will help you set up and run the app on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the app, you need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which comes with npm)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional but recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control, if you're cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)

If you havenâ€™t cloned the repository yet, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuhasPalani/React_Portfolio.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the directory where the React app code is stored. Since the React app is assumed to be at the root of the repository, you can skip a separate `cd portfolio` step.

```bash
cd React_Portfolio
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the libraries and packages defined in the `package.json` file.

### 4. Run the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React app, and you can view it by opening your browser and going to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

### 5. Build for Production (Optional)

If you want to create a production build of the app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized version of the app in the `build/` directory that can be deployed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing dependencies**: If you encounter issues related to missing dependencies, try running `npm install` again.
- **Port 3000 is already in use**: If you see an error about port 3000 being in use, you can specify a different port with the command:
  ```bash
  PORT=3001 npm start
  ```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
